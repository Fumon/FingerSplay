# Description

A custom mapping for the Kyria V2 which serves as a rapid prototype for an equivalent cross-platform and US-layout focused keymap.

# Areas of Use

Programming in Symbol-ful languages

Navigation meta keys (Ctrl-arrow, Ctrl+Shift+Arrow should be nicely under finger without stretching)

System administration on Linux
    Needs things like tab and forward slash to feel nice. Shortcuts for the major readline hotkeys would also be a good idea.
        - CTRL+W, CTRL+L, CTRL+A/E




# Goals:

Make Hyper keyboard chording less awkward as I use it with my window manager.

Revamp the symbols layers

Similar to [the 3l layout](https://github.com/jackrosenthal/threelayout) and [neo layout](), use MOAR modifiers.
    Specifically, the 3l layout's idea for right pinky finger buttons to act as symbol modifiers.
